# Environment Configuration for SVPathLab

## Current Configuration

Your application is currently set up with **dual authentication systems**:

1. **Clerk Authentication** (Primary)
   - Status: Configured with environment variables
   - Purpose: User authentication, account management
   - Domain setup: Main site and Account Portal

2. **Supabase** (Secondary)
   - Status: Configured and connected
   - Purpose: Database, file storage, and backend services
   - Note: While also capable of authentication, currently used for data services

## Environment Variables

### Clerk Authentication
- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Currently set âœ“
  - Used for: Authentication flows, user management
  - Format: Starts with `pk_live_` for production

### Supabase Connection
- Supabase credentials are currently cached in the browser
- Used for: Database operations and backend services

## Setting Environment Variables

### In Netlify (Recommended for svpathlab.com)
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Select your site (svpathlab.com)
3. Navigate to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
4. Ensure the `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set correctly
5. To add Supabase variables if needed:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anon/public key

### In Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
4. Add/verify the environment variables

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify your environment variables are correctly set
3. Clear browser cache or try in an incognito window
4. Ensure DNS records are properly configured for Clerk

## Next Steps

Given that both authentication systems are present:

1. **Decide on primary auth system**: 
   - Currently configured to use Clerk as primary
   - Can be switched to use Supabase auth if preferred

2. **Configure application logic**:
   - Update components to use your preferred auth provider
   - Consider removing unused auth system if not needed

For more detailed setup instructions, refer to the other documentation files:
- `ENV_CHECKER.md` - For checking Clerk environment variables
- `CLERK_DOMAIN_SETUP.md` - For Clerk domain configuration
